Reproducibility - preliminary remarks
======================================================

* Reminding ourselves : Reproducibility is the backbone of scientific activity
* Reproducibility versus replicability
* Is there a problem ?
    - Not everybody is convinced that there is a problem 
    - Do we have hard evidence ? 
* Plan: 
    - Evidence for the problem
    - Causes: especially power issues
    - What should we do

Reproducibility - evidence of the problem
======================================================

* In general: Nature, "Reducing our irreproducibility", 2013.
    - A new mechanism for independently replicating findings needed: Nature Biotech. (2012)
    - Easy to misinterpret artefacts as biologically important results: Nature (2012) 
    - Too many sloppy mistakes: Nature (2012)
    - Revised standard for statistical evidence (PNAS 2013)

* In epidemiology
    - Ioannidis 2011: “The FP/FN Ratio in Epidemiologic Studies:” 

* In social sciences and in psychology
    - Reproducibility Project: Psychology (open science foundation)
    - Simmons, et al. “... Undisclosed Flexibility ... Allows Presenting Anything as Significant.” 2011. 

* In cognitive neuroscience
    - Barch, Deanna M., and Tal Yarkoni. “Special Issue on Reliability and Replication in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Research.”  2013.

Reproducibility - evidence of the problem
======================================================

* Oncology Research: 
    - Begley C.G. & Ellis L. Nature, (2012): "6 out of 53 key findings could not be replicated"

* In brain imaging
    - Reproducibility Issues in Multicentre MRI Studies, Jorge Jovicich, Trento
    - Raemaekers,  “Test–retest Reliability of fMRI...",  2007, Thirion et al., 2007.

* In genetics
    - Ionannidis 2007: 16 SNPs hypothesized, check on 12-32k cancer/control: "... results are largely null." 
    - Many references and warning: eg:"Drinking from the fire hose ..." by Hunter and Kraft, 2007.

* And in imaging genetics ?

Why do we have a problem? 
===========================
* Things are getting complex
* Publication pressure is high
* Mistakes are done
* **_Power issues_**

Why do we have a problem? 
===========================
Things are getting complex
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Data complexity (eg: chip idiosyncrasies, format, preprocessings, etc)
* Data need to be linked appropriately (remember the Duke scandal)
* Data size: number of variables - files you cannot check visually
* Methods: increasing number of steps and statistical complexity, external software you have to trust, 

Why do we have a problem? 
===========================
Publication pressure is high 
--------------------------------
- There's no way there isnt a paper out of this data set. 
- You won't get your Phd if you don't publish this study
- You won't get tenure 
- You won't get funding or peers recognition
- Ratio Benefice / Risk in favor of risky and quick publication
- Conclusion: the pressure is *very* high

Why do we have a problem? 
===========================
Mistakes are done: unpopular topic
-------------------------------------

> "The scientific method’s central motivation is the ubiquity of error — the awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere and that the scientist’s effort is primarily expended in recognizing and rooting out error." 
_Donoho, 2009._

The power issue
===================

* Ioannidis 2005: _"Why most research findings are false"_
* Remember what is power
* What exactly are the issues of low powered studies
* Tools to compute power
* What is our effect size?

The power issue
===================

What is the effect ?
---------------------

$\hspace{3cm}\mu = \bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}$

What is the standardized effect ? (eg Cohen's d)
-------------------------------------------------

$\hspace{3cm}d = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sigma} = \frac{\mu}{\sigma}$

"Z" : Effect accounting for the sample size 
--------------------------------------------------

$\hspace{3cm}Z = \frac{\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$

The power issue
===================
What exactly is power ?
-----------------------

![Power: $\large{W = 1-\beta}$ Here W=77%](./images/what_is_pw.pdf)

Cohen's d and relation with n :
---------------------------------
$\hspace{3cm} d = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sigma} = \frac{\mu}{\sigma} \hspace{2cm}$ \large{$Z = \frac{\mu\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} = d \sqrt{n}$}


The power issue
===================
- Studies of low power have low probability of detecting an effect (indeed!)
- Studies of low power have low positive predictive value: $PPV = P(H1 True | Detection)$
- Studies of low power are likely to show inflated effect size 

The power issue
===================

- If we have 4/5 that H0 is true, and 1/5 that H1 true, with 30% power: PPV = 60%.

$PPV = P(H1 True | Detection) = \frac{W \, P_1}{\alpha \, P_0 + W \, P_1}$

-------------  ----------- ----------  --------
 P1/P0 =0.25   power=0.10,  alpha=0.05 PPV=0.33  
 P1/P0 =0.25   power=0.30,  alpha=0.05 PPV=0.60  
 P1/P0 =0.25   power=0.50,  alpha=0.05 PPV=0.71  
 P1/P0 =0.25   power=0.70,  alpha=0.05 PPV=0.78  
-------------  ----------- ----------  --------

The power issue
===================
What happens with more stringent $\alpha$?
-------------------------------------------------

![higher type I error threshold to account for MC](./images/pw_with_mc.pdf)

* effect on power: power goes down
* effect on PPV: PPV goes up 
* effect on estimated effect size: size bias: goes up

The power issue
===================

Studies of low power inflate the detected effect (2)
----------------------------------------------------

The power issue
===================

Studies of low power inflate the detected effect (1)
-----------------------------------------------------

The power issue
===================

What is the estimated power in common meta analyses? 
-----------------------------------------------------

![Button et al. NRN, 2013](./images/butt_fig2.pdf)


What is specific to Imaging Genetics
=======================================

- Combinaison of imaging and of genetics issues: "AND" (if independent: prob. of getting it right would multiply: .7 * .7 = .5)
- The combination of having to get very large number of subjects for GWAS and not being able to get them in imaging
- The multiple comparison issues
- The "trendiness" of the field
- The flexibility of analyses / exploration
- The capacity to "rationalize findings" (eg: noise in brain images is always interpretable)

Are imaging genetics studies reproducible?
==========================================

* Effect size in imaging genetics:
    - HTTLPR and amygdala: Hariri 2002: p-value implies that locus explain about 28% of phenotypic variance. 
    - KCTD8 brain growth: Paus 2012: 21% of phenotypic variance (250 subjects)
    - BDNF and hippocampal volume : genuine effect or winners curse? d=0.12, p=0.02, Molendijk (2012)
    - Stein et al, 2012: rs10784502 marker is associated with 0.58% of intracranial volume per risk allele 
    - COMT and DLPFC: meta analysis : d = 0.55, paper suggest > 62 subjects Meir (2009) 

* reproducibility / error rate
    - Silver, Montanna, Nichols (beware of low threshold forming clusters)
    - Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2008: Not a problem ? False positives in imaging genetics. However ... 
    - Flint and Mufano: First 2002 5-HTT result is unlikely

Effect size decreases with years
=====================================

What are the solutions: technical
=====================================

- Pre-register hypotheses 
- Statistics: 
    - Always try to get a sense of the power
    - Take robust statistical tools
    - Meta analysis if you can
    - Replication if you can 
    - Power analyses with the smallest effect size (cost does not enter in this calculation) 
    - Effect size variation estimation (bootstrapping)

CaTS-text --additive --risk 1.3 --pisample .95 --pimarkers 1. --frequency .3 --case 1067 --control 1067 --alpha 0.00000001 : yields For a one-stage study 0.314.


Train the new generation 
===============================

- Statistics: more in depth that what is usual. 
- Computing: how to check code, version control 
- A more collaborative (eg Enigma) and a more open science model (github for science)
- Work such that others in the community can reproduce **and** build upon

What are the solutions: social 
===================================

* Increase awareness of editors to:
    - Accept replication studies
    - Accept preregistration 
    - Increase the verifiability of analyses (code and data available)
* Share data / share intermediate results 
    - Increase the capacity of the community to verify
    - Increase capacity to do meta/mega analyses 
* Decrease publication pressure (change evaluation criteria)
